# Saplanting(Fabric)
A fabric mod that automatically plants sapling drops in minecraft games.  
Saplings from other mods are supported theoretically.  
Other plants are also available, if you configure them.  
Make sure that your Minecraft version is supported by the mod.  
This is a fabric mod, fabric api is required.

## Introduction

If you can not spare enough time and effort to plant saplings in Minecraft or the players on server are too lazy to do so, this mod will help you!  
When a sapling item drops on dirt(or something else that let saplings grow), it will automatically turn into sapling block in 2 seconds. The sapling-planting will not destroy the block that already take up the place(except air and replaceable blocks).  
What's more surprising, other plants can be automatically planted now! But this feature is disabled by default, use [commands](#Commands) below or [configure the JSON file](#Configurations).

## How to Install

1. Download the Jar File of proper version.
2. Copy or cut the jar file you've just downloaded to your mod path (usually ".../.minecraft/mods" or ".../.minecraft/versions/\<VersionName\>/mods")
3. Make sure you have installed fabric api and fabric of proper versions

## Configurations

Config file is located at ".../.minecraft/config/saplanting.json"
