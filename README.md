# Saplanting(Fabric)

A fabric mod that automatically plants sapling drops in minecraft games.  
Saplings from other mods are supported theoretically.  
Other plants (Actually, all items) are also available, if you configure them.  
Make sure that your Minecraft version is supported by the mod.  
If you use Fabric client, fabric api is required.

## Introduction

If you can not spare enough time and effort to plant saplings in Minecraft or the players on server are too lazy to do
so, this mod will help you!  
When a sapling item drops on dirt(or something else that let saplings grow), it will automatically turn into sapling
block in 2 seconds. The sapling-planting will not destroy the block that already take up the place(except air and
replaceable blocks).  
What's more surprising, other plants can be automatically planted now! But this feature is disabled by default,
use [commands](#Commands) below or [configure the JSON file](#Configurations).

## How to Install

1. Download the Jar File of proper version.
2. Copy or cut the jar file you've just downloaded to your mod path (usually `.../.minecraft/mods` or
   `.../.minecraft/versions/\<VersionName\>/mods`)
3. If you are using fabric, make sure you have installed fabric api and fabric of proper versions

### About Multiplayer

Main logic in this mod is nested on the server side, so only server side is necessary to install this mod.
If only client side is installed, it only works for single player.

## Configurations

Config file is located at `.../.minecraft/config/saplanting.json`  
Config file will only be automatically loaded when a world-save is loaded. If you want the changes in this file loaded
manually, use [commands](#Commands) to do so.

- plantEnable: Enable auto-planting, default: true, expect: boolean
- plantLarge: Try to plant 2x2 trees, default: true, expect: boolean  
  Only for sapling blocks that can be planted in shape of 2x2.
- showTitleOnOpConnected: Show disability for Saplanting on a server when an **operator** connected to this server,
  default: false, expect: boolean
- ignoreShape: Plant no matter the sapling can grow in shape of 1x1, default: false, expect: boolean
- warnTaskQueue: Show warning if task queue was too large, default: true, expect: boolean
- autoBlackList: If errors occurred during handling a specific item, add this item to blacklist, default: true, expect
  boolean
- language: Current language of Saplanting, default: "en_us", expect: String
- plantDelay: How many ticks before the sapling drop will be planted, default: 40, expect: non-negative integers
- avoidDense: The radius of area that will not plant when selected area already got other trees, default: 2, expect
  non-negative integers
- playerAround: Not to plant if player around, default: 2, expect non-negative integers

### Whitelist & Blacklist

From 1.3.0, properties like `allowXXX` are permanently removed. Now you can filter items in whitelist and black list.

Saplanting will only plant if the item matches any entry in whitelist and does not match any entry in blacklist.

You can add item ID or item tag to whitelist or blacklist.
For example, you can add `minecraft:dirt` (Item ID) or `#minecraft:saplings` (Item Tag) to any list.

Besides, you can add `*` to any list to match any item.
